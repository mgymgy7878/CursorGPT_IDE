V1.4 GLOBAL HALT & CLOSEOUT INDEX
================================

NONCE: 20250820-284500-147963
Date: 2025-08-20T28:45:00Z
Decision: RED
Status: HALT

STRATEGY ASSESSMENT:
-------------------
Total Strategies: 6
Deprecated: 5 (RSI14_MR, MACD_RSI_fusion, donchian_rsi_pullback, voltarget_ma, zscore_ma)
Hold: 1 (EMA50_200)
Promoted: 0

SYSTEM STATUS:
-------------
Kill Switch: ENABLED
Denylist Count: 6
Allowlist Count: 0
Guardrails: ACTIVE
Circuit Breaker: TESTED

AUDIT RESULTS:
-------------
Data Quality: PASS (score: 0.99)
Metrics Sanity: FAIL (Sharpe/CAGR inconsistencies, annualization mismatch, net-of-fee issues)

EVIDENCE ARTIFACTS:
------------------
- closeout.json: V1.4 closeout decision and assessment
- dq_report.json: Data quality audit results
- metrics_sanity.json: Metrics sanity check results
- manifest.sha256: File integrity manifest
- INDEX.txt: This index file

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
Immediate:
- Kill switch remains enabled
- Data quality audit completed
- Metrics sanity hard-gate required

Next Sprint:
- Alpha re-discovery with regime segmentation
- Walk-forward analysis framework
- ML Optimization Lab
- Metrics sanity hard-gate implementation

RE-ENABLE CONDITIONS:
--------------------
- New strategy passes all triage thresholds
- Metrics sanity hard-gate implemented and passing
- Data quality audit passes
- OOS positive ratio ≥ 0.60
- Fragility top ≥ 0.60
- Robust base ≥ 4

LESSONS LEARNED:
---------------
Technical:
- Metrics sanity issues were critical
- Annualization factors need proper implementation
- Net-of-fee calculations require validation

Process:
- Hard-gate metrics sanity checks are essential
- Data quality audits should be mandatory
- Kill switch and guardrails provide operational safety

Strategy:
- All tested strategies showed overfitting tendencies
- OOS performance was consistently poor
- Fragility under stress testing was inadequate
