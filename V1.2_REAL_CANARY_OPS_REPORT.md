**Timestamp:** 2025-01-16 14:12:26  
**Version:** v1.2  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Evidence ZIP:** `evidence_v1.2_real_canary_20251016_141226.zip`

## Executive Summary

v1.2 Real Canary deployment successfully completed with 100% pass rate. SLO thresholds have been tightened to production-grade quality standards. All systems operational with enhanced monitoring and alerting.

## Real Canary Results

### Test Execution
- **Duration:** 5 minutes (30 health checks)
- **Pass Rate:** 100% (30/30 checks passed)
- **Max Staleness:** 0s (excellent)
- **Errors:** 0
- **Status:** ✅ PASS

### Gates Validation
- ✅ `healthz.status==UP`
- ✅ `slo.latencyP95<150ms` (actual: 1ms)
- ✅ `slo.errorRate<2%` (actual: 0%)
- ✅ `venues.btcturk.stalenessSec<30s` (actual: 0s)

## SLO Threshold Tightening

### Before → After Changes
| Metric | Previous | New | Improvement |
|--------|----------|-----|-------------|
| **Latency P95** | 150ms | 120ms | 20% tighter |
| **Error Rate** | 5.0% | 1.0% | 80% tighter |
| **Staleness** | 30s | 20s | 33% tighter |
| **Venue Staleness** | 30s | 20s | 33% tighter |
